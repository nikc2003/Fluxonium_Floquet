General simulations within the Floquet framework.  
Includes Xiao and branch analysis to:
  1. evaluate onset of hybridization for state in computational manifold 
  2. visualize and pinpoint character exchanges/branch swaps

Files here should support sweeps against drive frequency or flux and composite model handling
as well as general Hamiltonian/spectrum analysis with the bare system.
